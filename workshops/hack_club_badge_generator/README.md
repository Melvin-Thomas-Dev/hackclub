We are all part of the hack club community and what better way to introduce yourself and the local hack club to which you belong, than with a stylish badge that will help you stand out from the crowd. In this workshop, we’ll teach you how to make a badge generator. It would be great if you had a basic knowledge of python but even if you don’t we have made this quite simple for you to easily pick up the concepts.

We will be making a badge generator wherein you can load your image and generate a badge with a beautiful template containing your name and hack club name as shown below.
